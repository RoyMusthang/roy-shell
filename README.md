# Simple Shell in Go

This project is a simple shell implemented in Go. It aims to provide a basic understanding of how a shell works and offers an opportunity to practice Go programming skills. The shell supports fundamental commands and features commonly found in basic shell environments.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute common shell commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `echo`, and more.
- **Built-in Commands**: Some commands are built into the shell itself for efficiency.
- **History**: Keeps a history of executed commands for easy recall.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for command execution failures.
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new commands and functionalities.

## Installation

To install and run the simple shell, ensure you have Go installed on your machine and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoyMusthang/roy-shell   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd roy-shell
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
4. Run the shell:
   ```bash
   ./simple-shell-go
   ```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can start entering commands. Here are a few examples:

- List files in the current directory:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
- Change directory:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory
  ```
- Print text to the terminal:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```
